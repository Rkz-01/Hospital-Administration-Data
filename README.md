Reducing Readmissions: A Data Analytics Case Study for Improved Patient Care
At Novartis Hospital, we're tackling high readmission rates through data analysis. Our aim is to identify the factors driving readmissions and implement targeted interventions for better patient outcomes. Using hospital admission data, we're examining age-specific readmission patterns, lengths of stay by medical specialty, correlations between emergency visits and readmissions, diabetes-related readmission rates, and the impact of medication changes on readmissions.
